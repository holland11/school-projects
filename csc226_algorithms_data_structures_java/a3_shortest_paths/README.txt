Input: A weighted graph G of n vertices. Each edge weight corresponds to the time to travel between two locations.
Output: For each 'charging station', the shortest path from the starting location to that charging station and the
	total distance of the trip.

This is an implementation of a shortest paths algorithm which executes in O(V^2 + E log V).
