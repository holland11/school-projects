; This program is for the ATMega2560 with an LCD shield.
; This is using my Assignment 2 submission as a template for testing the LCD functions.
; What I call milliseconds in this code are actually centiseconds.
; 
; This program utilizes the LCD screen and interrupts to simulate a stopwatch (aka a timer).
; The buttons can be used to pause / reset the timer and there is also the capability to 
; time 'laps'.
